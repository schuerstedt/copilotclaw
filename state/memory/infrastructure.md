## Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `COPILOT_PAT` | Auth for Copilot CLI agent | ✅ Working |
| `BILLING_PAT` | Same value as COPILOT_PAT; used for Copilot quota display | ⚠️ Needs "Plan" read permission added to PAT |
| `MOLTBOOK_API_KEY` | Crunch's Moltbook social network identity | ⚠️ Needs to be added as GitHub Actions secret |
| `AZURE_ENDPOINT` | Azure AI Foundry base URL | ✅ Set by Marcus |
| `AZURE_APIKEY` | Azure AI Foundry API key | ✅ Set by Marcus |

## Moltbook

- **Username**: `crunchci` (https://www.moltbook.com/u/crunchci)
- **Status**: Registered, pending claim by Marcus
- **Claim URL**: https://www.moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_v1tM8NcNmv8zBafBlZlBbkBAIsw3PhmO
- **Verification tweet**: `I'm claiming my AI agent "crunchci" on @moltbook 🦞 Verification: current-CCE4`
- **API key**: stored at `~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json` on runner; add as `MOLTBOOK_API_KEY` GitHub Actions secret for persistence across runs

## Workflows

- `agent.yml` — main Copilot CLI agent workflow
  - Has `pull-requests: write` permission (added 2026-03-04)
  - Does NOT have `workflows: write` — workflow file changes must be pushed from Marcus's local clone
- Heartbeat workflow — scheduled check, posts diary entry, runs CI stats, stale issue cleanup

## Known bugs fixed
- `mindepth` bug in session mapping workflow: was `mindepth 2`, fixed to `mindepth 3` (2026-03-04, issue #3)

## Stale issue housekeeping
- Heartbeat step 3: auto-closes unlabeled issues >14 days old
- `crunch/review` = in review by Marcus or Crunch — heartbeat asks for close after 7 days idle (no auto-close)
- `crunch/done` label DEPRECATED — replaced by `crunch/review`

## Azure AI Foundry

One key (`AZURE_APIKEY`) for all models. Endpoint: `AZURE_ENDPOINT`.

| Model | RPM | TPM | Quality | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|---------|-------|
| `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` | 50 | 50,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Default** — fastest, reliable, 49/50 benchmark |
| `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` | 50 | 50,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Same quality, 2x slower, use for hard reasoning |
| `Kimi-K2.5` | ~20 | — | ⚠️ | Flaky endpoint (content=None); avoid for now |
| `model-router` | ~20 | — | — | Needs AzureOpenAI client (not compat); 404s on compat |

**Use `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` as default for all azure skill calls.**

## Model economy
- General-purpose agents default to `gpt-4.1` (free tier) to save premium quota
- Defined in AGENTS.md under "Model Economy" table
- For LLM reasoning/generation tasks: use `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` via azure skill (50 RPM, cheap)
